# rss-codetest

To run the project you need to do a pod install at the project folder first.

Important Pendings:
- Manage authtoken expiration
- Manage no internet connection in a better way
- Implement refresh feed
- Implement read article
- Pull to refresh at list
- Lots of UI/UX improvements
- Lots of testing (Maybe unit cases also)
- There is a weird bug that sometimes shows an error with the connection even when should be fine. Needs more testing.

Until now I spent 8hs between reading the API, designing the storyboard on paper and coding.
